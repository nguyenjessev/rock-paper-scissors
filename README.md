# Rock, Paper, Scissors
This is my rock, paper, scissors project for The Odin Project

## Problems
I had trouble figuring out how to determine a winner without using a bunch of if-else statements

## What I used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, `switch` statements, DOM manipulation through JS

## What I learned
How to break a problem down into smaller parts and create snippets of code that solve individual problems, and then linking them together
